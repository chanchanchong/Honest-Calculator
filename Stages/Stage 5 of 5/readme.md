# Work on project Stage 3/5: Saving memory
### Project: Honest Calculator

### Description
To complete the project, you need to implement the flowchart below. The old blocks are red-colored. Be careful; some flows can work differently. The functions from the previous stage have not been changed.

Objectives
Implement the flowchart with two functions. Please, mind the recommendations below:
- Don't use the built-in function eval() to calculate from a string;
- Copy the messages carefully. The tests will check if the correct message appears in
  the correct order. Don't add extra lines or characters.

>msg_10 = "Are you sure? It is only one digit! (y / n)"

>msg_11 = "Don't be silly! It's just one number! Add to the memory? (y / n)"

>msg_12 = "Last chance! Do you really want to embarrass yourself? (y / n)"

Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Note that it's not part of the input.

Enter an equation

2 + 3

You are ... lazy

5.0

Do you want to store the result? (y / n):

y

Are you sure? It is only one digit! (y / n)

y

Don't be silly, it's just one number! Add to the memory? (y / n)

n

Do you want to continue calculations? (y / n):

Enter an equation

5 + M

You are ... lazy ... very, very lazy
